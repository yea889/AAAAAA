Pipedream is a serverless integration and compute platform.

We provide a free, hosted platform that makes it easy to connect apps and develop, execute and maintain event-driven workflows. The platform has over 300 fully integrated applications with managed authentication and support for over 1M npm packages.

**Key Features**:

- [Event Sources](#event-sources) - Open source [components](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components) that emit events from services (Github, Slack, Airtable, RSS & more)
- [Workflows](#workflows) - A sequence of linear steps - just Node.js code - triggered by an event (via event source, HTTP or timer)
- [Actions](#actions) - Pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations across Pipedream's 300+ API integrations, for example: sending email, adding a row to a Google Sheet, and more.
- [Destinations](#destinations) - Deliver events asynchronously to common destinations like Amazon S3, Snowflake, HTTP and email
- Serverless - No server or cloud resources to manage
- [Free](#pricing) - No fees for individual developers (see [limits](https://docs.pipedream.com/limits/))

**Product Demo**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ-KRbp6EO8&feature=youtu.be) (5 minutes)

## Event Sources

Pipedream receives data via event sources. Event sources are open source, run on Pipedream's infrastructure and collect data from your own application and/or services like Github, DropBox, Zoom, RSS feeds, and more.

Event sources emit new events produced by the service, which can trigger Pipedream workflows, or which you can consume using [Pipedream's REST API](https://docs.pipedream.com/api/rest/) or a private, real-time [SSE stream](https://docs.pipedream.com/api/sse/).

Here is the simplest event source possible, an HTTP event source:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: "http",
  version: "0.0.1",
  props: {
    http: "$.interface.http",
  },
  run(event) {
    console.log(event); // event contains the method, payload, etc.
  },
};
```

- [Twitter](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/components/twitter/readme.md) ([deploy](https://pipedream.com/sources/new?app=twitter))

Event sources can also be deployed via the [Pipedream CLI](https://docs.pipedream.com/cli/reference/). Once installed, you can deploy an event source by running:

```bash
pd deploy   # prompts you to select a component and pass required options
```

You can also create your own event sources for your own personal use. If you think others would benefit from your source, you can publish them to all Pipedream users by opening a PR in this repo. See these docs to get started:

- [Component API](COMPONENT-API.md)
- [HTTP Event Sources Quickstart](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/interfaces/http)
- [Timer-based Event Sources Quickstart](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/interfaces/timer)

## Workflows

Workflows are a sequence of linear [steps](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps) - just Node.js code - triggered by an event (via event source, HTTP endpoint, or timer). Workflows make it easy to transform data and integrate with 300+ APIs from various apps and services.

- Trigger your workflow on any event (e.g. [HTTP requests](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/triggers/#http) or a [schedule](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/triggers/#cron-scheduler)).
- Add steps to run [Node.js code](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/code/) (using virtually any npm package) and [pre-built actions](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/actions/).
- Steps are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.
- Data is shared between steps via [step exports](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/#step-exports).

Workflow code is [public by default](https://docs.pipedream.com/public-workflows/) so the community can discover and [copy them](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/copy/). Your workflow execution and event data is private.

You can copy [this example workflow](https://pipedream.com/@tod/use-http-requests-to-trigger-a-workflow-p_6lCy5y/readme) to get started, or review some [community-developed workflows](https://pipedream.com/explore) to see what others are building.

As you build more advanced workflows, you may also find these docs helpful:

- [Passing data to steps](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/#passing-data-to-steps-step-parameters) - steps are just Node functions, and can accept input via step parameters.

- [Error Handling](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/error-handling/global-error-workflow/#modifying-the-global-error-workflow) - how to use the Global Error workflow to manage errors raised by workflows.

## Actions

[Actions](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/actions/) are pre-built code steps that you can use to perform common operations across Pipedream's 300+ API integrations, for example: sending email, adding a row to a Google Sheet, and more. Pipedream currently supports over 1000+ actions.

Typically, integrating with these services requires a custom code to manage authentication, error handling, etc. Actions abstract that for you - you just pass the necessary params as input and the action handles the rest. For example, the **Send HTTP Request** action accepts the data you want to send and the URL you want to send it to, returning the HTTP response for use in future steps.

Actions come pre-built to solve a common use case, but you can modify them in any way you'd like. Actions are just Node.js functions. When you add an action, you'll see its code in your workflow - just click into the code and start editing to modify it.

Finally, you can [create your own actions](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/actions/#creating-your-own-actions), allowing you to re-use them across workflows in your account. You can even [publish actions](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/actions/#save-vs-publish) to the entire Pipedream community, making them available for anyone to use.

Here's the code for the **Send HTTP Request** action:

```javascript
async (params) => {
  const config = {
    method: params.method || "post",
    url: params.url,
  };
  for (const { key, value } of params.query || []) {
    if (!config.params) config.params = {};
    config.params[key] = value;
  }
  for (const { key, value } of params.headers || []) {
    if (!config.headers) config.headers = {};
    config.headers[key] = value;
  }
  if (params.auth) {
    config.auth = {
      username: params.auth.username,
      password: params.auth.password,
    };
  }
  if (params.responseType) {
    config.responseType = params.responseType;
  }
  if (params.payload) config.data = params.payload;
  return await require("@pipedreamhq/platform").axios(this, config);
};
```

## Destinations

[Destinations](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/), like Actions, abstract the connection, batching, and delivery logic required to send events to services like Amazon S3 and Snowflake, or targets like HTTP and email.

For example, sending data to an Amazon S3 bucket is as simple as calling `$send.s3()`:

```javascript
$send.s3({
  bucket: "your-bucket-here",
  prefix: "your-prefix/",
  payload: event.body,
});
```

Pipedream supports the following destinations today:

- [Amazon S3](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/s3/)
- [Snowflake](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/snowflake/)
- [HTTP](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/http/)
- [Email](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/email/)
- [Pipedream SQL Service](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/sql/)
- [SSE](https://docs.pipedream.com/destinations/sse/)
