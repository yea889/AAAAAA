<p>We believe anyone should be able to run simple, low-volume workflows at no cost. We also hope that you share your <a href="/event-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sources<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, <a href="/workflows/managing/#sharing-workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workflows<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, <a href="/components/actions/#creating-your-own-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actions<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, and other integration components so that other Pipedream users benefit from your work.</p>
<p>To support these goals, <strong>Pipedream offers a <a href="#developer-tier">generous free tier</a></strong>. You can run sources and workflows for free within the limits of the free tier. If you hit these limits, you can upgrade to one of our <a href="#professional-tier">paid tiers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="definition-of-terms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#definition-of-terms" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Definition of Terms</h2>
<p>Pipedream uses a number of terms to describe platform metrics and details of our plans. See the definitions of key terms below.</p>
<h3 id="invocations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#invocations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Invocations</h3>
<p>Pipedream counts an <strong>invocation</strong> each time a workflow or event source is triggered by an incoming event.</p>
<p>Pipedream increments the count of invocations by one for each incoming event, regardless of the number of steps in your workflow. For example, if you send an HTTP request to a workflow with five steps, Pipedream will count that as one invocation.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have a workflow triggered by a cron job running once a minute for the entire day, that will incur 1,440 invocations (60 minute * 24 hours). For cron-triggered workflows or event sources, remember that you can always reduce the frequency to reduce your invocations.</p>
<p>If an event emitted by an event source triggers a single workflow, that will count as <strong>two</strong> invocations: one for the source, and one for the workflow. In other words, source and workflow execution is distinct: each counts invocations on its own.</p>
<p>Your workflow's <a href="/workflows/settings/#memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memory settings<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> also impact the number of invocations you're charged for each workflow execution. <a href="#how-does-workflow-memory-affect-billable-invocations">Read more here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="compute-time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compute-time" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Compute Time</h3>
<p>Pipedream calculates <strong>compute time</strong> as the total time your workflow or event source runs user code.</p>
<p>Pipedream records a minimum time of <code>100ms</code> per execution. For example, if your workflow runs for <code>50ms</code>, you'll incur <code>100ms</code> of time towards your <a href="/limits/#compute-time-per-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily compute time quota<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>.</p>
<h3 id="billing-period" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#billing-period" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Billing Period</h3>
<p>Many of the usage statistics for paid users are tied to a <strong>billing period</strong>. Your billing period starts when you sign up for a paid plan, and recurs roughly once a month for the duration of your subscription.</p>
<p>For example, if you sign up on Jan 1st, your first billing period will last one month, ending around Feb 1st, at which point you'll start a new billing period.</p>
<p>Your invoices are tied to your billing period. <a href="/#when-am-i-invoiced-billed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more about invoicing / billing here<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>.</p>
<h3 id="base-invocations-quota" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#base-invocations-quota" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Base Invocations Quota</h3>
<p>When you sign up for a paid plan, you pay a platform fee at the start of each <a href="#billing-period">billing period</a>. This minimum monthly charge grants you a base of invocations that you can use for the rest of your billing period (see your <a href="https://pipedream.com/settings/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Billing and Usage Settings<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> for your exact quota). If you have been granted any additional invocation increases by Pipedream, that is added to the base quota. <strong>This total is called the base invocations quota</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="additional-billable-invocations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-billable-invocations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Additional Billable Invocations</h3>
<p>Any invocations you run over your <a href="#base-invocations-quota">base invocations quota</a> are called <strong>additional billable invocations</strong>. This usage is added to the invoice for your next <a href="#billing-period">billing period</a>, according to the <a href="#when-am-i-invoiced-billed">invoicing cycle described here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="faq" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#faq" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="what-are-invocations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-invocations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are invocations?</h3>
<p>Pipedream counts an <strong>invocation</strong> each time a workflow or event source is triggered by an incoming event.</p>
<p>Pipedream increments the count of invocations by one for each incoming event, regardless of the number of steps in your workflow. For example, if you send an HTTP request to a workflow with five steps, Pipedream will count that as one invocation.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have a workflow triggered by a cron job running once a minute for the entire day, that will incur 1,440 invocations (60 minute * 24 hours). For cron-triggered workflows or event sources, remember that you can always reduce the frequency to reduce your invocations.</p>
<p>If an event emitted by an event source triggers a single workflow, that will count as <strong>two</strong> invocations: one for the source, and one for the workflow. In other words, source and workflow execution is distinct: each counts invocations on its own.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-workflow-memory-affect-billable-invocations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-workflow-memory-affect-billable-invocations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How does workflow memory affect billable invocations?</h3>
<p>Pipedream charges invocations proportional to the memory configuration. If you run your workflow at the default memory of <code>{{$site.themeConfig.MEMORY_LIMIT}}</code>, you are charged one invocation each time your workflow executes. But if you configure your workflow with <code>1024MB</code> of memory, for example, you're charged <strong>four</strong> invocations, since you're using <code>4x</code> the default memory.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-any-limits-on-paid-tiers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#are-there-any-limits-on-paid-tiers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Are there any limits on paid tiers?</h3>
<p><strong>You can run any number of invocations, for any amount of compute time</strong>, on paid tiers. <a href="/limits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other platform limits<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> apply.</p>
<h3 id="when-am-i-invoiced-billed-for-paid-plans" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-am-i-invoiced-billed-for-paid-plans" aria-hidden="true">#</a> When am I invoiced / billed for paid plans?</h3>
<p>When you upgrade to the Professional tier, Stripe will immediately charge your payment method on file for the platform fee tied to your plan (see <a href="https://pipedream.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pipedream.com/pricing<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>)</p>
<p>If you accrue any <a href="#additional-billable-invocations">additional billable invocations</a>, that usage is reported to Stripe throughout the <a href="/pricing/#billing-period" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">billing period<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>. That overage, as well as the next platform fee, is charged at the start of the <em>next</em> billing period.</p>

<p>Pipedream stores no information on your payment method and uses Stripe as our payment processor. <a href="/security/#payment-processor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See our security docs<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="are-unused-invocations-rolled-over-from-one-period-to-the-next" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#are-unused-invocations-rolled-over-from-one-period-to-the-next" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Are unused invocations rolled over from one period to the next?</h3>
<p><strong>No</strong>. On the Developer tier, unused daily invocations (and compute time) under the daily limit are <strong>not</strong> rolled over to the next day.</p>
<p>On paid tiers, unused invocations included as a part of the base platform fee are also <strong>not</strong> rolled over to the next month.</p>
