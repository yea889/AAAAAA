# API Overview

Pipedream currently offers [REST](/api/rest/) and [Server-sent Events (SSE)](/api/sse/) APIs.

- Use REST APIs to create and manage sources and source events
- Use the SSE API to subscribe to real-time event streams for sources

Workflow development and management is not currently supported via API.

::: warning
Sources and related APIs are current currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period features and APIs may change without advance notice. Please reach out on [Slack](https://pipedream.com/community) or raise an issue on our [Github repo](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream) with any questions or suggestions.
