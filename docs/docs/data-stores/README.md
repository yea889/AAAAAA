# Data Stores

**Data Stores** are first class databases available in your workflows. You leverage data stores to easily retrieve and store data at any time during your workflow runs.

It's useful for counting values, or summing up data between run, or tracking unique data points like email addresses and much more.

Data stores are:

* Persisted between workflow runs
* Shareable between workflows
* Don't require any setup or external connections

You can also use native pre-built actions to store, update, clear data without code.
