# Pricing

We believe anyone should be able to run simple, low-volume workflows at no cost, sharing their workflows with the public so everyone benefits from the work of others. We also want to foster a positive community where people feel good about sharing their work and where everyone can learn from one another.

**Pipedream is free**, subject to the following constraints:

- Your data is private, always, but your workflows are public by default (you can [make any workflow private](/workflows/managing/#workflows-are-public-by-default-your-data-is-private)). [Read more here](/public-workflows/).
- Your workflows run within our [limits](/limits/).
- You follow our [Acceptable Use](https://pipedream.com/terms/#b-acceptable-use) policy. In short this means: don't use Pipedream to break the law; don't abuse the platform; and don't use the platform to harm others.

In the future, we may offer features available on paid tiers.

If you're hitting limits on our free tier, or have any questions, please [reach out](/support/).
